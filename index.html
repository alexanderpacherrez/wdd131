            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello my name is Alexander. I am living in Lima because I am working at MTC as a trainer. 
                I like to play soccer with friends. I try to be a good person, sometimes it is complicating but I try. 
                I like to read and sing, when I feel frustrated because of my homework, I like to remember why I am doing this. 
                I can receive divine help. Sometimes I like to play videogames.
                I am studying software development at BYU, I am learning many things every week, sometimes I feel frustrated 
                because the tasks are not that simple, but I try to remember that I am building forever and I know that even 
                though now it may be difficult as I try and do my part, the Lord Jesus Christ will help me with this. 
                My family is my driving force to continue, I am studying because I want to give them a better quality of life, 
                little by little I know that I will achieve it.</p>

            <p>Peru, officially the Republic of Peru, is a country in western South America. 
                It is bordered in the north by Ecuador and Colombia, in the east by Brazil, in the southeast by Bolivia, 
                in the south by Chile, and in the south and west by the Pacific Ocean. The sovereign state of Peru is a representative 
                democratic republic divided into 25 regions. Its main economic activities include mining, manufacturing, agriculture 
                and fishing, along with other growing sectors such as telecommunications and biotechnology. This mixture of cultural 
                traditions has resulted in a wide diversity of expressions in fields such as art, cuisine, literature, and music.</p>

        <h2>FAVORITE MOVIES</h2>
        <p>The films that you will see below have had a great
            impact on my life, they have helped me and taught me
            great things that have made me who I am today.</p>
        <a>Who I am?</a>

            <h3>The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</h3>
            <h4>2005 . PG . 2h 23m</h4>
            <p>From this movie I learned that things exist far beyond our imagination. 
            The good will always be good and the bad will always be bad.
            I love the final part when the Pevensies brothers want to tell the professor what happened 
            but they think that maybe he wouldn't believe them, he looks at them and says "Try me."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="movie-two">

                <source srcset="images/movies/xmen/web.webp" media="(min-width: 500px)" >
                <img src="images/movies/xmen/mobile.webp" alt="X-Men: Days of Future Past" loading="lazy" width="500" height="250">
            </picture>
            <h3>X-Men: Days of Future Past</h3>
            <h4>2014 . PG-13 . 2h 12m</h4>
            <p>"Just because someone stumbles and gets lost doesn't mean they are lost forever." 
                Every time I read this phrase it gives me the courage to continue in the face of all kinds of situations. 
                If this movie taught me anything, it is that our future is not defined, we are responsible for what we want to achieve.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="movie-three">
            <picture>
                <source srcset="images/movies/gotg2/web.webp" media="(min-width: 500px)">
                <img src="images/movies/gotg2/mobile.webp" alt="Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2" loading="lazy" width="500" height="250">
            </picture>
            <h3>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2</h3>
            <h4>2017 . PG-13 . 2h 16m</h4>
            <p>The incredible music of this movie captivates me every time I have the opportunity to see it, 
                the performances of each of the characters really make me feel close to them, 
                I especially love getting to know more about Star Lord and Yondu, their father to son connection simply It's magic. 
                One of the phrases I love the most is "I don't use my head to fly the arrow, boy! I use my heart."</p>

        <div class="movie-four">
            <picture>
                <source srcset="images/movies/butterfly-effect/web.webp" media="(min-width: 500px)" >
                <img src="images/movies/butterfly-effect/mobile.webp" alt="The Butterfly Effect" loading="lazy" width="500" height="250">
            </picture>
            <h3>The Butterfly Effect</h3>
            <h4>2004 . R . 1h 53m</h4>
            <p>If you could travel to the past, what would you change? The premise of this film means that anyone who sees it can quickly 
                become involved in what is happening to Evan Treborn's character. I could say that this was one of the films 
                that made my imagination fly, sometimes I have thought that by reading my diaries I can also do the same, unfortunately that is not the case.</p>

            <h3>Loki</h3>
            <h4>TV Series . 2021-2023 . TV-14</h4>
            <p>Can a person born for evil really be redeemed? Thanks to this series I know that yes, 
                Loki has become my favorite Marvel character. I love his wit, his personality, his sense of humor, 
                it's really part of the essence that if someone puts his mind to it he can really change for the better."</p>

            <h3>The Mandalorian</h3>
            <h4>TV Series . 2019-2023 . TV-14 . 40m</h4>
            <p>This is the way. If I have learned anything with The Mandalorian, it is that sometimes we can change our ideals for something greater, 
                the first season was too brutal, the scenes and characters really catch you and make you connect with what they are experiencing. 
                The Mandalorian is the nickname I have taken when it comes to video games, I want to be another Mandalorian.</p>

            <h3>X-Men '97</h3>
            <h4>TV Series . 2024 . TV-14 . 22m</h4>
            <p>In this world there are many, many people who fight daily to be accepted, most of these people strive daily to be part of society, 
                I believe that this is the emblem of the xmen, they know who they are but they are They strive to ensure that 
                others also know and accept it.</p>

            <h3>Sleepy Hollow</h3>
            <h4>TV Series . 2013-2017 . TV-14 . 45m</h4>
            <p>Is it possible to return to life after almost 200 years? It seems that it is, at least in this series, 
                I remember the moments of my adolescence that I lived watching this series, this really had a great impact on 
                my desire to know more about American history as well as religion, I think that thanks to this series was that I 
                took the first steps towards knowing more about the good and the bad.</p>

            <h3>Leonardo DiCaprio</h3>
            <h4>Producer . Actor . Writer</h4>
            <p>It has been said many times that he who perseveres achieves. In this case it was, Leo is one of the best actors 
            I have had the blessing of seeing act, the various roles that he has been able to play are a simple example of this. 
            I felt a lot of joy when in 2016 he managed to win the Oscar for best actor, he really deserves it, 
            his performances and his dedication to the world of acting stand out.</p>

            <h3>Matt Damon</h3>
            <h4>Producer . Actor . Writer</h4>
            <p>Why did he have to fight for the Oscar together with Leonardo DiCaprio? Simple, both are incredible, 
            Damon's versatility makes his characters remain marked in your heart, I remember a lot the first time I saw 
            a movie of his around when I was 8 years old, without a doubt a great admiration began. He is what you 
            could say, a versatile actor.</p>

            <h3>Ryan Gosling</h3>
            <h4>Producer . Actor . Director</h4>
            <p>SRyan Gosling is one of those guys who, even if he doesn't like something in particular, still does it, 
            especially when we talk about acting. Recently, there was great controversy surrounding his role in Ken, 
            but I greatly admire the humility and drive that he provides, his presentation at the Oscars was truly 
            sublime and magnificent. His interpretations are subtle and I love that.</p>

            <h3>James McAvoy</h3>
            <h4>Actor . Director . Producer</h4>
            <p>I never thought that that faun from the Chronicles of Narnia movie would become what James McAvoy is today, 
            I have seen him grow and really be the actor that he wants to become, recently I was watching some of his latest 
            movies and It is truly a joy to be able to see him perform. Without a doubt of all the actors I admire, he is one of my favorites.<br>
